An outline of my plans and intentions for this project.

I have decided to gather data on intraday and day ahead European power prices with the aim of developing a model that can forcast day ahead prices of power across Europe.
I intend on gathering data in prices from as many sources a possible, starting with the EPEX SPOT exchange, which is the main exchange for power trading in Europe.
I will also look at other exchanges and data sources, such as Nord Pool, the UK power market, and any other relevant sources of data.
On top of this, I will gather data on weather conditions, such as temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation, as these factors can have a significant impact on power prices.
I will also look at other factors that can influence power prices, such as fuel prices, carbon prices, and any other relevant economic indicators.

Once I have all the data gathered an organised, my plan is to developa an effective model for forcasting day ahead prices of power using a number of Mathematical and ML models in an attempt to make the most accurate model possible.
Once I am confident that I have developed an accurate model for forcasting day ahead prices of power, I indend on using this model to develop and backtest a trading strategy capable of showing consistent returns over a long period of time.
Due to the size of the data files, I am unable to upload the data that I have collected. I will continue to work on this project and perhaps upload the results of it here upon completion.

A further note, the Project is in a more organised format on my PC, which contains the csv files which were too large for github.
